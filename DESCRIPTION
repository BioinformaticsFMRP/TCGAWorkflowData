Description: 
  This experimental data package has the data necessary to follow the TCGA Workflow: Analyze cancer genomics and epigenomics data using Bioconductor packages.
  It contains the following files:
    - GBMnocnvhg19: segmented CNV from SNP array (Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array
      6.0) for 20  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  samples.
   - GBMIllumina_HiSeq: a matrix with  raw expression signal for expression of a gene for
     20 GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme) samples
   - LGGIllumina_HiSeq: a matrix with  raw expression signal for expression of a gene for
     20 LGG (Lower grade glioma) samples
   - met.20.samples.GBM.LGG.chr9:  DNA methylation matrix from Infinium HumanMethylation450 platform 
     for 10 LGG (Lower grade glioma) and 10 GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme). 
     It has only probes in chromossome 9  in order to make the example  of the workflow faster
   - elmer.example: Contains a DNA methylation matrix (only probes in chromossome 9) and a gene expression matrix for 
     10  LGG (Lower grade glioma) and 10 GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme) in the required format
     for to execute the R/Bioconductor ELMER package analysis and a vector 
     identifying which sample belongs to each tumor type.
   - maf_mutect2_LGG_GBM: Mutation annotation files for LGG (Lower grade glioma) and GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme)
     samples merged into a single matrix. The GDC Somatic Mutation Calling Workflow mutect2 was used to create this MAF files. 
   - markersMatrix: Probes meta file from broadinstitute website for Copy Number Variation Analysis (CNV) analysis
